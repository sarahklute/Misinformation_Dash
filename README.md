# ds3500_final
Code for the ds final

In general, the code I have is kind of a mess. With the exception of the word cloud stuff, the commented stuff is probably not necessary it was just me wrapping my head around potential visualizations. Clean it up and edit it however you see fit lol. 

For the dashboard layout, if you want to beutify it or indicate places where I should write some text go crazy lol.


What I have in here right now is a rough rough outline of the plotly dash visualizations. 
For the first one, cut the blue column and make sure that the slider is represting a range and not just greater then any word count. 
FOr the next one, if you want to play with it go crazy but we can probably just delete. 
For the sentiment vs. word count, make sure the scale is staying the same and it might be nice to color code it. 
For the pie chart maybe we can add a second pie chart that is doing the same thing but for the 10 highest percent of factually accurate titles. Also if you can, see if you can make the article titles the non cleaned ones so it still has stop words, punctuation, and capitalization.
For the sentiment score vs retweet it looks pretty good but do what you think.
For the word clouds, I am having trouble downloading the png files and getting them up to the dashboard. The code that I had is in there but commented out. [This]([url](https://community.plotly.com/t/how-to-embed-images-into-a-dash-app/61839)) is the documentation that I was playing with. See if you can get it up but if not all good.

text me if you have any questions ill be on my computer typing up the article after my tour ends at 5.
